# Script-Drawer
The Script Drawer is like the catch all drawer, were everything goes thats not destended for the trash, but not really gonna use unless I look back on here and use again... 
It used to be called my scripts... but due to inpatience and lack of time.. I deleted the old one to replace it with the more orginized one..
Below is the original README.md

# myscripts
Inside these files are scripts that were wrote for verious reasons, 
I think I ought to change it to somthing reflecting an equivilent of a catch all drawer

### Theses Scripts are wrote for debian based linux distros but there are also some powershell and some python in here to

### !!*Use these at your own risk*!!
### ( alot of these scripts have failed or didn't work, so be careful, but I keep em here just in case I may need to look at them again.. but irrigardless I'm not at fault for any !@#$ ups that may have happened to your systems if you run them, after all... I did warn you)
## 1)Whats inside??

### Now What???
#### Whats new here?
Well... Alot has happened and I suppose I got caught up, just by enough..
I had my I.T. Bag stolen, and with the way life was I was basically living out of the bag... Inside was everything, and as for college... I suppose Ill find out later.. but its not looking good.
Time and time again, if it is not one thing then it is another... I'm not one to give up or give in, but it is really hard to stay motivated when it seems like the world is agienst you.. 
I'll know more possibly later...Maybe...
Life is just getting a little hard to see why I should continue... with any of it.. or at all anymore.. 
But we'll see as time draws on..
